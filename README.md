This is an R package that contains the functions for generating patterns of segregation, association, Uniform data, and various non-random labeling patterns for disease clustering in two dimensional cases, and for testing the spatial patterns (of segregation, spatial symmetry, association, disease clustering, species correspondence and reflexivity) based on NN relations, especially using contingency tables such as nearest neighbor contingency tables, NN symmetry contingency tables, species correspondence contingency tables and reflexivity contingency tables for two- and higher-dimensional data, for visualization for the two dimensional data. The tests are usually (asymptotic) normal z-tests and chi-square tests.
