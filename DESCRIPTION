Title: Nearest Neighbor Methods for Spatial Patterns
Version: 0.1.1
Author: Elvan Ceyhan
Maintainer: Elvan Ceyhan <elvanceyhan@gmail.com>
Description: Contains the functions for testing the spatial patterns (of segregation, spatial symmetry, 
      association, disease clustering, species correspondence and reflexivity) based on nearest neighbor relations, 
      especially using contingency tables such as 
      nearest neighbor contingency tables (Ceyhan (2010) <doi:10.1007/s10651-008-0104-x> and 
      Ceyhan (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.jkss.2016.10.002> and references therein),
      nearest neighbor symmetry contingency tables (Ceyhan (2014) <doi:10.1155/2014/698296>),
      species correspondence contingency tables and reflexivity contingency tables (Ceyhan (2018) <doi:10.2436/20.8080.02.72>)
      for two (or higher) dimensional data. Also contains functions for generating patterns of segregation, association,
      uniformity in a multi-class setting (Ceyhan (2014) <doi:10.1007/s00477-013-0824-9>), 
      and various non-random labeling patterns for disease clustering in two dimensional cases (Ceyhan (2014)
      <doi:10.1002/sim.6053>), and for visualization of all these patterns for the two dimensional data.
      The tests are usually (asymptotic) normal z-tests and chi-square tests.
