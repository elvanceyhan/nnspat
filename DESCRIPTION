Title: NN Methods for Spatial Patterns
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Elvan Ceyhan
Maintainer: Elvan Ceyhan <elvanceyhan@gmail.com>
Description: Contains the functions for testing the spatial patterns (of segregation, spatial symmetry, 
association, disease clustering, species correspondence and reflexivity) based on NN relations, especially
using contingency tables such as nearest neighbor contingency tabels, NN symmetry contingency tables,
species correspondence contingency tables and reflexivity contingency tables
for two (or higher) dimensional data. Also contains functions for generating patterns of segregation, association,
uniformness, and various non-random labeling patterns for disease clustering in two dimensional cases, and for 
visualization of these patterns for the two dimensional data. The tests are usually (asymptotic) normal z-tests
and chi-square tests.
